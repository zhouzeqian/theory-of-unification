#Preface
1. Which one comes first: Does object movement creates force (vector collisions between particles) or on the contrary, force changes the movement of the object? The same question applies to time. This is important because it determines the development direction of physics. In my view, force is a measurement unit for motion, and time reflects the change speed of objects.

2. Are we heading the wrong direction in the study of physics? Advanced mathematics did not make its appearance before the presence of the number of zero, one, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. I always feel that researchers engaged in physical study are using calculus to solve basic operations. Quantum physics can be compared to basic arithmetic operations while classical physics is calculus.

3. The less the individuals ( particles) are in number, the less balanced they will be. The more they are, the more balanced they are (refer to air pressure)

4. Perhaps we cannot get the essence of the universe if we do not look at the universe from a microscopic point (particles) of view.
   Physical Model Hypothesis
1. All materials are composed of particles; there are definitely zero point particles and ideal particles of physical characteristics (point particle and completely elastic collision)

2. Forces in reality (inter-atom force, inter-molecule force, magnetic force, Lorenz force, gravity, etc.): confrontation between the orderly and the disorderly is essentially the vector collision between particles. Ordered flows of particles are moving towards one direction, and therefore will finally become disordered because they will lose their due to failure to collide with particles from other directions (such as vertical direction). The perfect preservation is sphericity.

3. The basic particle is a sphere (refer to 3) formed by the rotation of a number of zero point particles (positive particles rotate in the direction of P, and antiparticles rotate in the direction of N).

4. Spheres rotating in the same direction repel each other and spheres rotating in different direction attract each other (refer to 3)

5. Rotation combination of P+N generates larger particles; P+N collision leads to annihilation and decomposing.

6. Collision of particles moving in P+P direction can turn to collision; collision of particles moving to N+N direction can turn to movement in P direction. Angle and speed are key factors in these movements.

7. All energy is movement of particles in essence. Energy and material are  symbiotic. Energy is the embodiment of different type, movement and speed of particles. Energy absorption and transformation  involves the combination and collision of particles. Transmission of energy or force is impossible without a medium.

8. Ordered energy includes nuclear energy, electricity, magnetic energy, chemical energy and so on; disordered energy includes heat energy, light energy and electromagnetic energy etc.
   Physical Derivation
1.	The vanished substances in nuclear reaction or annihilation reaction are all converted into dark matter at the end, and what released is the kinetic energy from the rotation of particles. Presumably, dark matter is the dominant force behind the expansion of the universe. So does the gravity, which is quite like the air.

2.	Both time and energy can be slowed down, but cannot be reversed.

3.	The increased mass and slowed time at the speed of light is likely to be the result of collision in merge.

4.	The three laws of thermodynamics: the elastic collision law of particles, the rotation law of sphere, the disordered collision law of high-speed and low-speed particles.

Movement speed of particles in the space vary: vector collision.
